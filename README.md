5. **Exercise 04: MAC**
6. **Exercise 05: Can you create it?**
7. **Exercise 06: ft_print_alphabet**
8. **Exercise 07: ft_print_numbers**
9. **Exercise 08: ft_is_negative**
10. **Exercise 09: ft_ft**
11. **Exercise 10: ft_swap**
12. **Exercise 11: ft_div_mod**
13. **Exercise 12: ft_iterative_factorial**
14. **Exercise 13: ft_recursive_factorial**
15. **Exercise 14: ft_sqrt**
16. **Exercise 15: ft_putstr**
17. **Exercise 16: ft_strlen**
18. **Exercise 17: ft_strcmp**
19. **Exercise 18: ft_print_params**
20. **Exercise 19: ft_sort_params**
21. **Exercise 20: ft_strdup**
22. **Exercise 21: ft_range**
23. **Exercise 22: ft_abs.h**
24. **Exercise 23: ft_point.h**
25. **Exercise 24: Makefile**
26. **Exercise 25: ft_foreach**
27. **Exercise 26: ft_count_if**
